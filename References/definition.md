## How Python uses Indentation to control Flow

All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code, i.e. the statements within a block line up vertically. The block ends at a line less indented or the end of the file. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right.

## Don't Repeat Yourself

It is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

## Design Patterns from Gang of Four

Design patterns provide solutions to common software design problems. In the case of object-oriented programming, design patterns are generally aimed at solving the problems of object generation and interaction, rather than the larger scale problems of overall software architecture. They give generalised solutions in the form of templates that may be applied to real-world problems.

The Gang of Four are the authors of the book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".

## Class

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Object

Object is an element of a class; they have the behaviors of their class.

## Static

Static means, that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level. Static variables exist only in single instance per class and are not instantiated.

## Property / Attribute

Attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object.

Property decorator lets a method to be accessed as an attribute instead of as a method with a '()'.

## Method

Methods is very similar to functions except for two major differences. It is implicitly used for an object for which it is called. It is accessible to data that is contained within the class.

## Exception

An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

## Unit Test

Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. 

## Constructor

A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in a class.

## Factory

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Decorator

A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. 

## Extend Class

In Python, when a subclass defines a function that already exists in its superclass in order to add some other functionality in its own way, the function in the subclass is said to be an extended method and the mechanism is known as extending.

## CSV File

A CSV is a comma-separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format.

## Reading File

file.read(n) – This method reads n number of characters from the file, or if n is blank it reads the entire file.
file.readline(n) – This method reads an entire line from the text file.
